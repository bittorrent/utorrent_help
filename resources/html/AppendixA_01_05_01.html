<h3><a class="name" id="Graphical_Progress_Bars" href="#Graphical_Progress_Bars">Graphical Progress Bars</a></h3>
<ul class="uienum">
  <li>The <a class="name" id="Graphical_Progress_Bars.upper_Downloaded_Bar" href="#Graphical_Progress_Bars.upper_Downloaded_Bar">upper Downloaded
bar</a>
is the general progress bar useful for getting a quick visual outlook
of the percent completed. Selective file downloading is taken into
account, so only the data you select to be downloaded will be counted.
The number to the right of the Downloaded bar is the percentage of the
torrent job that is completed, taking selective file downloading into
account as well.
    <ul class="sublist">
      <li><a class="name" id="Graphical_Progress_Bars.upper_Downloaded_Bar.White" href="#Graphical_Progress_Bars.upper_Downloaded_Bar.White">White</a>
represents what has not yet been downloaded.</li>
      <li><a class="name" id="Graphical_Progress_Bars.upper_Downloaded_Bar.Blue" href="#Graphical_Progress_Bars.upper_Downloaded_Bar.Blue">Blue</a>
represents what has been downloaded.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>The <a class="name" id="Graphical_Progress_Bars.lower_Downloaded_Bar" href="#Graphical_Progress_Bars.lower_Downloaded_Bar">lower Downloaded
bar</a>
is equivalent to the upper bar, except that it does not take selective
file downloading into account, and it also displays the distribution of
pieces completed in your torrent job. If there are more pieces in the
.torrent file than there are horizontal pixels for your desktop
resolution, µTorrent will take the average completion of adjacent
pieces to decide what colors should be shown.
    <ul class="sublist">
      <li><a class="name" id="Graphical_Progress_Bars.lower_Downloaded_Bar.White" href="#Graphical_Progress_Bars.lower_Downloaded_Bar.White">White</a>
represents the pieces that have not yet been downloaded.</li>
      <li><a class="name" id="Graphical_Progress_Bars.lower_Downloaded_Bar.Blue" href="#Graphical_Progress_Bars.lower_Downloaded_Bar.Blue">Blue</a>
represents the pieces that have been downloaded.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>The <a class="name" id="Graphical_Progress_Bars.Availability_Bar" href="#Graphical_Progress_Bars.Availability_Bar">Availability bar</a>
shows the spread of the pieces in the network of peers you are
connected to. If there are more pieces in the .torrent file than there
are horizontal pixels for your desktop resolution, µTorrent will take
the average completion of adjacent pieces to decide what colors should
be shown. The number to the right is the actual availability of the
selected torrent job.
    <ul class="sublist">
      <li><a class="name" id="Graphical_Progress_Bars.Availability_Bar.Dark_blue" href="#Graphical_Progress_Bars.Availability_Bar.Dark_blue">Dark blue</a>
means the piece is available and common.</li>
      <li><a class="name" id="Graphical_Progress_Bars.Availability_Bar.Light_blue" href="#Graphical_Progress_Bars.Availability_Bar.Light_blue">Light blue</a>
means the piece is available, but rare.</li>torrent content size
      <li><a class="name" id="Graphical_Progress_Bars.Availability_Bar.Red" href="#Graphical_Progress_Bars.Availability_Bar.Red">Red</a> means the
piece is not available within the group of peers you are connected to.</li>
    </ul>

<p>Along with graphical progress bars, textual statistics are provided
below. Any of these fields can be copied by <span class="mouse">right-click</span>ing
it and selecting "<em>Copy</em>".
The following is a description of the information displayed (note that
most of the information displayed here can be found in the torrent jobs
list):</p>
<h3><a class="name" id="Transfer" href="#Transfer">Transfer</a></h3>
<ul class="uienum">
  <li><a class="name" id="Transfer.Time_Elapsed" href="AppendixA_01_05_01.html#Transfer.Time_Elapsed">Time Elapsed</a>

been started.</li>
  <li><a class="name" id="Transfer.Remaining" href="AppendixA_01_05_01.html#Transfer.Remaining">Remaining</a>
displays the estimated amount of time needed for µTorrent to finish
downloading the torrent job. If the torrent job is in seeding mode,
then the ETA displays the estimated time it will take for µTorrent to
reach the seeding goal. If the torrent job is stopped, this field will
be blank. If the torrent job is transferring too slowly, or has reached
its seeding goal, this field will display the <span class="value">∞</span>
symbol. Note that this field takes selective file downloading into
account, so only the data you select to be downloaded will be counted.</li>
  <li><a class="name" id="Transfer.Wasted" href="AppendixA_01_05_01.html#Transfer.Wasted">Wasted</a>
displays the amount of data that was downloaded and deleted, either
from hashfails, or from redundant data. The number in the parentheses
is the count for the number of hashfails that occurred.</li>
  <li><a class="name" id="Transfer.Downloaded" href="AppendixA_01_05_01.html#Transfer.Downloaded">Downloaded</a>

the total amount of data you have uploaded since the torrent job was
added.</li>
  <li><a class="name" id="Transfer.Seeds" href="AppendixA_01_05_01.html#Transfer.Seeds">Seeds</a>
displays the number of seeds you are connected to. The second number is
the number of known seeds in the peer cache collected from the tracker,
DHT, and PEX. The number in the parentheses is the number of seeds
reported by the tracker scrape.</li>
  <li><a class="name" id="Transfer.Download_Speed" href="AppendixA_01_05_01.html#Transfer.Download_Speed">Download Speed</a>
displays the current speed at which data is being downloaded for the
individual torrent job. The number in the parentheses is the average
download speed throughout the time that the torrent job was in
Downloading mode.</li>
  <li><a class="name" id="Transfer.Upload_Speed" href="AppendixA_01_05_01.html#Transfer.Upload_Speed">Upload Speed</a>
displays the current speed at which data is being uploaded for the
individual torrent job. The number in the parentheses is the average
upload speed throughout the time that the torrent job was started.</li>
  <li><a class="name" id="Transfer.Peers" href="AppendixA_01_05_01.html#Transfer.Peers">Peers</a>

the number of known peers in the peer cache collected from the tracker,
DHT, and PEX. The number in the parentheses is the number of peers
reported by the tracker scrape.</li>
  <li><a class="name" id="Transfer.Download_Limit" href="AppendixA_01_05_01.html#Transfer.Down_Limit">Down Limit</a>

  <li><a class="name" id="Transfer.Upload_Limit" href="AppendixA_01_05_01.html#Transfer.Up_Limit">Up Limit</a> displays
the maximum upload rate limit set on the individual torrent job. If no
limit is set, or the limit is set to <span class="value">0</span>,
this field will display the <span class="value">∞</span> symbol.</li>
  <li><a class="name" id="Transfer.Share_Ratio" href="AppendixA_01_05_01.html#Transfer.Share_Ratio">Share Ratio</a>
displays the ratio of uploaded data to downloaded data. You can
calculate it by dividing the number beside the <a href="AppendixA_01_05_01.html#Transfer.Uploaded">Uploaded</a> field by
the number beside the <a href="AppendixA_01_05_01.html#Transfer.Downloaded">Download</a>
field. If the torrent job was added when the file was already complete
(seeding the file upon adding), then the ratio will start from <span class="value">0</span>, and will be calculated based on the ratio of
the uploaded data to the torrent content size.</li>
  <li><a class="name" id="Transfer.Share_Ratio" href="AppendixA_01_05_01.html#Transfer.Status">Status</a>

the total amount of data in the torrent contents, taking selective file
downloading into account. The second number is the total amount of data
you have downloaded that passed the hash checks and have been written
to disk. If there is a third number here, then it's because you are
using selective file downloading. That third number displays the total
size of the torrent contents, not taking selective file downloading
into account.<a class="name" id="General.Comment" href="#General.Comment">Comment</a>
shows the comment placed in the .torrent file by the .torrent file's
