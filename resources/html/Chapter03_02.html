<p>In some cases, you might find that you need to move your files, be it due to simple reorganization, possibly to reinstall Windows, or maybe even to move &micro;Torrent and all the torrent jobs along with their contents to a new computer. In any case, the process is simple, though it can turn out to be a lengthy one. Realize that along the way, you might lose your accumulated statistics for each torrent job, but that does not mean you lose the statistics on the associated trackers, so do not fret about that.</p>

<h3><a class="name" id="Reinstalling_Your_Operating_System" href="#Reinstalling_Your_Operating_System">Reinstalling Your Operating System</a></h3>
<p>In the simplest of cases, reinstalling your operating system only requires you to make a backup of the data onto a new drive or partition if the torrent contents and <a href="AppendixB_01.html">&micro;Torrent settings directory</a> are located on the same drive or partition as the operating system you are trying to reinstall. After everything is completed, you simply have to move the files back to their previous locations, and &micro;Torrent will resume everything without issue. If you did not have an <a href="AppendixB_01.html#Encapsulated_Installation">encapsulated "installation"</a> of &micro;Torrent, then make sure you have the same username before moving the settings directory back into <span class="value">%AppData%</span>. If you are unable to perform any of the above, you will have to take the long route of performing the migration as if you were really <a href="#Moving_Torrent_Contents">moving the torrent contents</a>.</p>

<h3><a class="name" id="Moving_to_a_New_Computer" href="#Moving_to_a_New_Computer">Moving to a New Computer</a></h3>
<p>Migrating &micro;Torrent to a new computer simply requires that you copy your files to your new hard drive, along with backing up the entire <a href="AppendixB_01.html">&micro;Torrent settings directory</a>. The most difficult part of this process comes with the placement of the &micro;Torrent directory and the torrent contents. If you want to complete the process with minimal effort, it becomes a simple matter of making sure the paths for all the files related to &micro;Torrent and the torrent contents on the new computer are identical to the respective paths on the old computer.</p>
<ul>
	<li>If you had an encapsulated "installation" of &micro;Torrent, an identical username is not necessary. Otherwise, if the &micro;Torrent settings directory was located in <span class="value">%AppData%\uTorrent</span>, then you will have to create a user with the same exact account name on the new computer as on the old computer, then move the &micro;Torrent settings directory into the proper location on disk.</li>
	<li>If you plan on moving the drive over to the new computer, then as long as the drive letter remains the same, you save yourself the headache of dealing with paths. Otherwise, if you're going to copy the files from the old drive to the new drive, then you should make sure the torrent contents' paths remain identical.</li>
</ul>
<p>If any of those tips fail, and you are unable to keep paths identical for either the settings directory or the torrent contents, then you're in for a very long ride, and will have to perform everything as if you had moved the torrent contents.</p>

<h3><a class="name" id="Moving_Torrent_Contents" href="#Moving_Torrent_Contents">Moving Torrent Contents</a></h3>
<p>This process, if you haven't already figured it out, might require the most amount of time out of any of the "migration" processes, as it might require that you allow &micro;Torrent to verify the data integrity of the torrent contents after the move. What's time consuming isn't really the procedure itself, but the fact that rechecking can take a lot of time, depending on the torrent contents' sizes, and how many different torrent jobs you want to move.</p>
<p>Remember that the torrent contents are either a single file or a single folder (containing more files and folders, usually). The name of this file or folder is in &micro;Torrent's Name column, and by default, it matches the .torrent file name (without the .torrent suffix). The Save Directory column points to the content location, which is the parent folder of the torrent contents.</p>
<p>If the torrent contents haven't yet been moved, follow this procedure:</p>
<ul>
<li>Decide if you want to rename the torrent contents from the default. If you do, then change the name in the Name column before doing the next step. (You may also want to rename the downloaded .torrent file to match, in case you ever need to reload it.)</li>
<li>In the torrent job's advanced options, <a href="AppendixA_01_04.html#Context_Menu.Torrent_Options.Advanced.Set_Download_Location">set the download location</a>. The torrent contents will immediately be moved to the folder you select. It's safe to do this even if the torrent job is active.</li>
<li>That's it; you're done.</li>
</ul>
<p>Alternatively, you can move the contents without using &micro;Torrent:</p>
<ul>
<li>In &micro;Torrent, if the torrent job is active, stop it.</li>
<li>Outside of &micro;Torrent, move the torrent contents to wherever you like.</li>
<li>Then follow the steps below to inform &micro;Torrent that the contents have been moved.</li>
</ul>
<p>If the torrent contents have already been moved, tell &micro;Torrent where they are:</p>
<ul>
<li>If you gave the torrent contents a new name, then in &micro;Torrent, in the Name column, change the torrent name to match.</li>
<li>In the torrent job's advanced options, <a href="AppendixA_01_04.html#Context_Menu.Torrent_Options.Advanced.Set_Download_Location">set the download location</a>. Choose the torrent contents' actual parent folder. (If the contents <em>are</em> a folder, make sure you don't choose that folder; you want one level up.)</li>
<li>If you chose the right folder, you will be prompted that the file move target exists, and you'll be asked whether to overwrite. If you choose Yes, then the existing content will be erased and you will need to re-download, so probably the answer you want is No. If you were not prompted, then you probably chose the wrong folder, or the torrent name in &micro;Torrent doesn't match the torrent contents name on disk.</li>
<li>In the torrent job options, choose <a href="AppendixA_01_04.html#Context_Menu.Torrent_Options.Force_Re-Check">Force Re-check</a>.</p>
</ul>
<p>In any case, if you need to move the contents of many torrents, you can set their locations all at once by selecting all of their jobs (hold Shift or Ctrl while choosing), before <a href="AppendixA_01_04.html#Context_Menu.Torrent_Options.Advanced.Set_Download_Location">setting the download location</a> on one of them. You will be prompted multiple times for a destination folder, once for each torrent.</p>
