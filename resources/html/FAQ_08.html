<h3><a class="name" id="How_can_uTorrent_be_so_fast_and_small" href="#How_can_uTorrent_be_so_fast_and_small">How can µTorrent be so fast and small?</a></h3>
<p>µTorrent is programmed in C++ using custom-coded libraries, with the
GUI being written using the Win32 API. It is compressed with UPX to
bring the size down by approximately 50% from its normal compiled size.
A serious effort is made to keep the program as resource-efficient as
possible.</p>

<h3><a class="name" id="How_do_you_pronounce_uTorrent" href="#How_do_you_pronounce_uTorrent">How do you pronounce µTorrent?</a></h3>
<p>Although there is no official way to pronounce µTorrent, Ludvig
Strigeus wrote, "I usually say 'you torrent' because [the µ] looks like
a u." He also offered "microtorrent" and "mytorrent" as alternative
pronounciations.</p>

<h3><a class="name" id="How_do_you_write_u_on_the_keyboard" href="#How_do_you_write_u_on_the_keyboard">How do you write µ on the keyboard?</a></h3>
<p>If you are using an international IME as your keyboard input language, press <span class="key">AltGr</span>+<span class="key">M</span>, or <span class="key">Ctrl</span>+<span class="key">Alt</span>+<span class="key">M</span>. Alternatively, you can press <span class="key">Alt</span>+<span class="key">0181</span> (with the numbers pressed serially on the number pad), which works on all IMEs and regional settings.</p>

<hr>
<h3><a class="name" id="Is_uTorrent_open_source" href="#Is_uTorrent_open_source">Is µTorrent open source?</a></h3>
<p>No, it is not open source, and it is very unlikely that it will ever become open source.</p>

<hr>
<h3><a class="name" id="Is_there_a_Linux_or_Mac_OS_X_version_of_uTorrent" href="#Is_there_a_Linux_or_Mac_OS_X_version_of_uTorrent">Is there a Linux or Mac OS X version of µTorrent?</a></h3>
<p>You can download the Mac version of µTorrent <a href="http://www.utorrent.com/downloads/mac">here</a>. For those of you wishing to run µTorrent on a non-Windows
operating system, <a href="Chapter03_04.html">the Wine project offers a solution</a>.</p>

<hr>
<h3><a class="name" id="What_is_AppData" href="#What_is_AppData">What is %AppData%?</a></h3>
<p><span class="value">%AppData%</span> is a Windows environment
variable that contains the path to the standard user application data
directory. To access it, you can press "<em>Start</em>" button on the Windows taskbar, select "<em>Run</em>," type <span class="value">%AppData%</span> into the "<em>Open</em>" field, and press "<em>OK</em>."</p>

<h3><a class="name" id="Where_can_I_get_the_latest_uTorrent_beta" href="#Where_can_I_get_the_latest_uTorrent_beta">Where can I get the latest µTorrent beta?</a></h3>
<p>Occasionally, public beta testing builds are posted on the download
page, in the forum, or in the IRC channel. If there is no public
posting... well, if you have to ask for the beta builds, then you can't
get them :)</p>

<p>If you think you've found a bug, please make sure it is not caused by any <a href="FAQ_07.html">incompatible software</a>. If the bug is reproducible, please visit the "Found Bugs" forum in the <a href="ExternalLinks.html#uTorrent">µTorrent forums</a>
and make sure your bug has not already been reported. If not, then
register and post instructions on how to reproduce the problem.</p>
<p>If you have a feature you'd like to request, visit the forum and
search to make sure it was not previously requested. If you post a
request without first looking, then chances are fairly high that you
will be told to search, and the thread will be locked.</p>
<p>If you have an unanswered question, visit the forum or IRC channel
and ask. Searching the forum and reading the forum stickies are
important things to do while at the forum.</p>
