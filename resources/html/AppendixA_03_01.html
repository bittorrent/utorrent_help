<div id="content">
<p>The <strong>Favorites</strong> tab manages filters that allow µTorrent to
automatically download specific torrents from a RSS feed. </p>

<p>This dialog is also explained in the exmaple in Chapter 02 - "<a
href="Chapter02_05.html">Downloading Using the RSS Downloader</a>" .</p>
<ul class="uienum">
  <li><a class="name" id="listbox" href="#listbox"></a>The listbox displays all
    filters that µTorrent will use when parsing the RSS feeds. If the checkbox
    next to a filter is checked, it will be used by µTorrent to pick out a
    torrent to download. Otherwise, the filter is ignored by µTorrent. Filters
    can be sorted using <span class="mouse">drag-and-drop</span>.</li>
  <li>The <a class="name" id="Add" href="#Add">Add</a> button allows you to
    enter a new filter for µTorrent to use when parsing RSS feeds. After you
    press "<em>Add</em>", you must name the filter immediately. You can edit
    this name later by selecting the filter from the listbox and pressing <span
    class="key">F2</span> on your keyboard. An alternative is to slow <span
    class="mouse">double-click</span> the filter and rename it directly.</li>
  <li>The <a class="name" id="Delete" href="#Delete">Delete</a> button allows
    you to delete the filter that is currently selected.</li>
  <li>The <a class="name" id="question_mark" href="#question_mark">?</a>
    (question mark) button tests displays the last time the selected filter
    matched a torrent. It also displays the last 4 torrents matched (if any)
    and any currently-matching torrents from all applicable feeds. This can be
    used to double-check your filter.</li>
  <li>The <a class="name" id="Filter" href="#Filter">Filter</a> field allows
    you to tell µTorrent what you want to match. <a
    href="AppendixB_03.html">Wildcards</a> can be used to generalize the
    filter. Note that you cannot specify the season or episode number in this
    filter if it is decoded by µTorrent. You must use the episode number box,
    or enable "<em>Filter matches original name instead of decoded name</em>".
    This field is case insensitive.</li>
  <li>The <a class="name" id="Not" href="#Not">Not</a> field allows you to
    specify text that, if matched by a torrent, will cause µTorrent to ignore
    it. <a href="AppendixB_03.html">Wildcards</a> can be used to generalize the
    filter. Note that you cannot specify the season or episode number in this
    filter if it is decoded by µTorrent. You must use the episode number box,
    or enable "<em>Filter matches original name instead of decoded name</em>".
    This field is case insensitive.</li>
  <li>The <a class="name" id="Save_in" href="#Save_in">Save in</a> field allows
    you to specify where you want µTorrent to download the torrent contents
    to. If this field is specified, µTorrent will automatically start the
    torrent job. Note that if you already have a default download location set,
    you do not have to set a directory here.</li>
  <li>The <a class="name" id="Feed" href="#Feed">Feed</a> dropdown menu allows
    you to select a particular feed that you want the filter to apply to. If
    you want µTorrent to apply this filter to every feed, leave this dropdown
    menu as <span class="value">(All)</span>.</li>
  <li>The <a class="name" id="Quality" href="#Quality">Quality</a> menu allows
    you to select the quality of the torrents, if it is a video. If what you
    want to filter is not a video, leave this option as <span
    class="value">ALL</span>. Note that setting this option is not an absolute
    necessity, even if you are trying to download a video.</li>
  <li>The <a class="name" id="Episode_Number" href="#Episode_Number">Episode
    Number</a> field allows you to specify specific episodes to download. This
    field supports ranges, so if you want to download episodes <span
    class="value">1</span> through <span class="value">26</span> of season
    <span class="value">3</span> of some series, you input <span
    class="value">3x1-26</span> into this field. If you want to specify the
    ending season in addition to the starting season, you can enter something
    like <span class="value">3x1-4x15</span> into the field. If you want to
    specify the beginning of a range, but not the end (you would like µTorrent
    to continue every subsequent episode, including in later seasons),
    something like <span class="value">3x1-</span> would suffice. Notice the
    <span class="value">-</span> (hyphen) after the <span
    class="value">1</span>. If you prefer, <span class="value">S3E1</span> can
    also be used to specify episodes instead of the above-shown <span
    class="value">3x1</span>.</li>
  <li><a class="name" id="Filter_matches_original_name_instead_of_decoded_name"
    href="#Filter_matches_original_name_instead_of_decoded_name">Filter matches
    original name instead of decoded name</a> forces µTorrent to apply the
    filter on the torrent name itself. Normally, µTorrent parses the torrent
    name and applies the filter on the decoded name, which excludes certain
    things like quality and episode number.</li>
  <li><a class="name" id="Dont_start_downloads_automatically"
    href="#Dont_start_downloads_automatically">Don't start downloads
    automatically</a> tells µTorrent to add torrent jobs matching the favorite
    in stopped mode instead of starting them automatically.</li>
  <li><a class="name" id="Give_download_highest_priority"
    href="#Give_download_highest_priority">Give download highest priority</a>
    places a matching torrent at the top of the download queue (#<span
    class="value">1</span>). Because this is not a forced start, if you pass
    your maximum number of active torrent jobs after this torrent job gets
    started, the started torrent closest to the end of the queue will be
    stopped and will have to wait on the queue.</li>
  <li><a class="name" id="Smart_ep_filter" href="#Smart_ep_filter">Smart ep.
    filter</a> causes µTorrent to download the first version of each new
    episode that matches your filter. Note that you should not enable this
    option if the episode number is not parseable (when the <a
    href="AppendixA_01_04.html#Episode">Episode</a> column is empty).</li>
  <li>The <a class="name" id="Minimum_interval"
    href="#Minimum_interval">Minimum interval</a> dropdown menu sets the
    minimum interval between each time the filter is matched. For example, if
    set to <span class="value">2 days</span>, µTorrent will not attempt to
    match the filter again until at least 2 days have passed. 
    <ul class="sublist">
      <li><a class="name" id="Minimum_interval.match_always"
        href="#Minimum_interval.match_always">(match always)</a> tells
        µTorrent to check the filter for matches every time it checks the RSS
        feeds.</li>
      <li><a class="name" id="Minimum_interval.match_only_once"
        href="#Minimum_interval.match_only_once">(match only once)</a> tells
        µTorrent to use the filter only once. After a torrent job is added to
        the torrent jobs list by the filter, µTorrent won't check the filter
        for any more matches.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>The <a class="name" id="Reset" href="#Reset">Reset</a> button forces
    µTorrent to forget when it last matched the filter.</li>
  <li>The <a class="name" id="Label_for_new_torrents"
    href="#Label_for_new_torrents">Label for new torrents</a> combobox tells
    µTorrent to set any torrent that matches this filter to the specified
    label.</li>
