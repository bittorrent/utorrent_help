<p>RSS is a function in µTorrent to automatically view and download torrents
from your favorite torrent site! Sites like <a
href="http://www.dailytvtorrents.org/">DailyTvTorrents</a> publish their
torrents using RSS feeds, allowing for clients such as µTorrent to display new
torrents within them.</p>

<h3>Adding a feed</h3>

<p>Click on the Add RSS icon in the toolbar, or right click on All Feeds and
choose "Add RSS Feed." Enter your RSS feed's URL into the input box, and check
Custom Alias if you want to give a name to the feed.</p>

<h3>Disabling a feed</h3>

<p>To disable a feed, simply right click the feed in the category list and
choose "Disable Feed." If you want to re-enable it, simply right click again
and choose "Enable Feed."</p>

<h3>Renaming a feed</h3>

<p>You can rename a feed or edit the URL by either right clicking it and
choosing "Edit Feed" or double clicking on it.</p>

<h3>Viewing releases on an RSS feed</h3>

<p>To view the releases for an RSS feed, click on the feed. Alternatively,
click on "All Feeds." You can also view multiple feeds at once by holding Ctrl
and clicking multiple feeds, or even combine releases and your torrents by
clicking on a feed and a label or category for loaded torrents. All the
releases currently on the feed will show in the main listview. Double clicking
will attempt to download the .torrent for the release. To open the release's
URL in your browser, right click it and choose Open URL in Browser.</p>

<p>Extra columns of information are available for RSS feeds. To enable or
disable them, right click on the name of any column. You can also click and
drag columns to rearrange them. These settings are independent of the columns
available when viewing your loaded torrents.</p>

<h3>Using feeds that require HTTP authentication</h3>

<p>For feeds that require HTTP authentication, simply use this format for the
feed URL: http://username:password@sometorrentsite.com/rss.php</p>

<h3 id="cookie">Using feeds that require cookies</h3>

<p>To use feeds that require cookies, you must find the cookie for the site,
and grab UID and pass from it.</p>
<ul>
  <li>IE users will find their cookies in %UserProfile%\Cookies</li>
  <li>Firefox users will find their cookies in Tools -&gt; Options -&gt;
    Privacy -&gt; Show Cookies</li>
  <li>Opera users will find their cookies in Tools -&gt; Advanced -&gt;
  Cookies</li>
  <li>Users of other browsers will have to consult their browser's
  documentation</li>
</ul>

<p>Once you have the appropriate information, use this format for the feed
URL:</p>

<p>http://sometorrentsite.com/rss.php:COOKIE:uid=1234;pass=asdjh12378912y3lkj</p>

<p>Not every site uses uid and pass as the cookie variables, or use additional
ones, so one MUST use the exact variable name and the extra variables they
specify. For example, a certain site uses id, password, and secure as its
cookie variables.</p>

<h3>Automatically downloading torrents</h3>

<p>To automatically download all torrents from a feed, you can open the Edit
Feed dialog and choose "Automatically download items published in feed."
Checking the smart episode filter will make it only download the first version
of a particular episode. The smart episode filter not work if the "Episode"
column is blank.</p>

<p>If you want to download only specific releases, there are two ways to do
that. The simpler method is to right click on the relevant release in the list
and choose "Add to favorites." This will add it to your Favorites list and
bring up the RSS Downloader dialog for further editing of your favorite.</p>

<p>The alternative method to automatically download specific releases is to
right click on any feed or "All Feeds" and choose "RSS Downloader," or press
Ctrl-R. This will bring up the "RSS Downloader" dialog.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Hit Add, then type the name of the favorite.</li>
  <li><p>Click on the editbox next to Filter: and add your filter. The allowed
    wildcards are * and ?</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Multiple filters can be entered by separating each one with a |</li>
      <li>An example of a filter you could use would be *MP3 Archives*</li>
      <li>If you have a strange feed using underscores or something besides
        periods, you can also try something like *Go?Open*</li>
      <li>Do not specify an episode or season number here. This will break the
        filter. Use the episode number function instead. Adding them here will
        only work if "filter matches original name instead of decoded name" is
        checked. This may be required for non-standard episode formats or
      dates.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This is the minimum required to setup a favorite. The rest of the
    functions are extra features for more control of the automatic downloads.
    The following example setting will download all episodes of "The Show" with
    a 720p resolution: </p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><img alt="" src="../img/rss_demo.png"
style="display: block; text-align: center; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto"
width="825" height="723" /></p>
<ul>
  <li>Not: allows you to exclude certain strings from matching. An example is
    you don't want releases with AC3 audio and H.264: you can write
    *AC3*|*H*264|*x*264* in Not: to exclude those.</li>
  <li>By default, torrents will automatically download to My
    Documents\Downloads. If you want the torrents to download to a specific
    folder, you must either specify a folder in Save in: or set a default
    download path in the "Directories" section of µTorrent's preferences.</li>
  <li>Feed: chooses what feed you want the filter to apply to; either all of
    them or a specific one</li>
  <li>Quality allows you choose various qualities to match against, or allow
    all. You can choose more than one quality in the dropdown list.</li>
  <li>Episode number is to download only specific ep numbers, say to avoid
    releases of old episodes. It supports multiple formats. For example, to
    download only the first 12 episodes of season 1, type in 1x1-1x12 or
    1x1-12. Or to download starting from episode 13 of season 1 and include all
    later seasons, type in 1x13-</li>
  <li>"Don't start downloads automatically" will add any downloaded torrents in
    Stopped mode. They will be added to your list, but will not begin
    downloading until you choose them from the torrent list and start them.</li>
  <li>"Filter matches original name instead of decoded name" is so that you can
    match based off what the original name is in the feed (given in the Name
    column), instead of µTorrent's parsed result.</li>
  <li>Give download highest priority sets all torrents downloaded automatically
    through RSS to the top of the queue, making your seeds and other downloads
    get queued if you reach the max active torrents.</li>
  <li>Smart ep. filter makes µTorrent only download the first version of each
    new episode that matches your filter. This function will only work if the
    "Episode" column is not blank.</li>
  <li>Minimum interval sets a minimum interval between matches for the filter:
    if you set it to 2 days, µTorrent will not download anything for at least
    2 days after a match.</li>
  <li>You can use the Reset button to make µTorrent forget that it has
    downloaded episodes and the last time matched for that filter.</li>
  <li>Label for new torrents auto-sets a label for torrents that match the
    filter.</li>
  <li>All changes are automatically saved when you make them, so you don't have
    to do anything once you're done editing the filter.</li>
  <li>You can select a filter and press ? to see what the last four episodes
    were that matched, and the last time that the filter matched something. A
    list of the currently matching episodes from the feeds you've defined for
    it is also available in the "?" dialog, so you can double-check your filter
    expression.</li>
</ul>
